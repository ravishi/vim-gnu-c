This is a small improvement on the
`previous work <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=575>`_
by Dean Scarff on the support for the GNU coding standars for C
programming on VIM. His plugin overrides the default C plugin, setting
the GNU coding standard as default for all C code you edit. What I did
was to create a new filetype, called *gnuc* so you can switch easily
between the two.  Also, I think it may be possible to create some kind
of autodetection, but I'm too lazy for that right now.
